How does trust in government vary by income, race, and education?

To determine how much trust in the government someone had, we looked at the question, "How often respondent trusts the federal government in Washington to do what is right" (V241229).

To determine income, we used Household Income Category (V241567x).

To determine race, we used Race/Ethnicity (V241507x).

To determine education, we used Educational Attainment (V241509).

We also wanted to control for age, sex, economic status, marital status (V241461x), registered state (V242058x), and party affiliation ().
